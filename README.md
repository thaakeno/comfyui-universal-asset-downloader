## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Navigate to your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory and clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thaakeno/comfyui-universal-asset-downloader.git
    ```
    (Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the newly created folder and install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    cd comfyui-universal-asset-downloader
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    For MEGA support, it is also recommended to install `mega-cmd` from the official website for your operating system. The node will fall back to `mega.py` if it's not found.

3.  **Restart ComfyUI:**
    Restart your ComfyUI server. The new node will be loaded automatically.

## Usage

1.  **Add the Node:** In the ComfyUI editor, right-click and select `Add Node` -> `utilities/downloaders` -> `üåê Universal Asset Downloader`.
2.  **Paste URL:** Copy the URL of the asset you want to download from Civitai, Hugging Face, or MEGA and paste it into the `asset_url` field.
3.  **Select Asset Type:**
    *   Leave it as `"Auto"` for the node to intelligently detect the correct asset type.
    *   Manually select the type if you want to override the detection.
4.  **Provide API Keys (Optional):** For private repositories or to avoid rate limits, provide your Civitai and/or Hugging Face API keys.
5.  **Execute:** Queue the prompt. The node will download the file to the correct subfolder within your ComfyUI models directory and output the final file path.
